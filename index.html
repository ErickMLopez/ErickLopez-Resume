        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a twenty-one year old who has a lot of drive, intelligence, and very good work ethic. I am someone living in a hispanic household with two brothers and my two parents in a small apartment in the city of Pomona, California. Having shared almost everything (bedroom, restroom, food, etc) with family, I have learned how to work in a team, and be considerate of others around me. There have been many challenges in my life that have made me a better person overall. One example could be my financial situation which has allowed me to manage my finances efficiently in a manner that my hard work does not go to waste. Another example of challenges I have faced are my parents immigration status which has allowed my problem solving skills to improve. I have had to find ways to work around problems my parents immigration status has caused like when submitting fafsa. I had to be able to reach out to people and grow to not be afraid of asking the questions needed to resolve problems. I am a latino male who has not allowed his hardships to bring me down but instead take them all as lessons to learn from.<br><br>

        My educational experience includes my three years of college education at the University of California Riverside. I am currently a business administration major. Through my time spent at the University of California Riverside I have learned many hard skills that work with my business major such as: knowledge in financial reporting, customer relationship manager, microsoft office, and programming. I have also learned soft skills such as digital literacy, public speaking, and professional writing. University of California Riverside has really helped me grow into an independent person who has matured enough to work in an environment professionally and effectively. I am looking for a career in business including operations management, financial management, and administrative supervisor. I have the leadership skills needed to organize, guide, and mentor my fellow associates.<br><br>

        I have worked a total of three jobs in my current lifetime and they all have taught me lessons. My first job included working at the LA County Fair at a game station. This is where I learned the basic skills of communication. I learned to communicate with customers so that they feel welcomed, encouraged to play, and happy to play. I learned to work with customers and work with coworkers. It is my first instance of hard labor at a workplace. In my second occupation I worked in a trampoline place called Get Air where I learned to work as a team and learn to deal with kids. We would have tasks assigned to everyone and everyone played a role in making customers experience a great one. In dealing with kids I had to learn to be level headed and authoritative at the same time. That level-headedness and authority can help me in future careers. In my last occupation I worked as a front-end supervisor in Ross. I was able to learn skills in time management - keeping track of all my associates and their breaks alongside keeping track of customer service is tough. To be able to multitask in an efficient manner is someone I can successfully do because of the amount of experience I have obtained.
